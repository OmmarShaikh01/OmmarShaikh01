<h1 align="left">Introduction</h1>

Hi, I am **Ommar Shaikh** currently studying **Computer Science** in **India**. As a freelance developer, I have extensive experience working with various technologies, including Python Django, Web Development, Android, Software Testing, REST APIs, App Development, Docker, Container Orchestrating, Grafana, InfluxDB, OAuth, and Cloud Architecture.

One of my primary areas of expertise is in Python Django development. I have built several web applications using this framework, from simple web pages to complex systems. I am proficient in using Django for backend development, including database management, authentication, and API development. I have also developed RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.

In addition to web development, I have experience in Android app development. I am proficient in Java and Kotlin, and I have built several mobile applications for clients using these languages.

I am also skilled in software testing and have developed a range of test cases for web and mobile applications. I have experience with both manual and automated testing, and I can use various tools such as Selenium and Pytest.

Moreover, I have experience working with Docker, a containerization technology that enables developers to package their applications and dependencies into a portable container. I have used Docker to streamline the deployment process of applications and to ensure consistency across different environments.

I am also familiar with container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes, which enable developers to manage and automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In terms of monitoring and analytics, I have experience working with Grafana and InfluxDB. I have used these tools to visualize and analyze metrics and logs generated by applications and systems.

Additionally, I have experience working with OAuth, an open standard for authorization that enables secure API authorization flows. I have integrated OAuth into several applications to provide secure and seamless user authentication.

Lastly, I have experience in cloud architecture, including the design and implementation of scalable and reliable cloud-based applications. I have worked with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and I am familiar with cloud-based services such as load balancing, auto-scaling, and cloud storage.

Overall, I am a well-rounded developer with experience in various aspects of software development, including web development, mobile app development, software testing, containerization, monitoring and analytics, authentication, and cloud architecture.
